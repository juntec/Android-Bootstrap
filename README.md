Android-Bootstrap
=================
<h3>Changes:</h3>
* NEW colors
* BootstrapButton now extends Button (removes code like set setBootstrapButtonEnabled(boolean enabled) since it gets these methods from Button
* User no longer has to download the WebAwesome font and put it in their project
* Changed button colors to brighter colors
* Added Gradient Buttons
* Added Purple Button
* Changed filenames so they are more consistent
* Added styles to buttons and edittexts
